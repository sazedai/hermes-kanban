# Wiki Schema

## Domain
AI Agents, Sub-Agent Delegation, and Autonomous Workflows — with focus on Hermes Agent, multi-agent systems, and AI-powered productivity.

## Conventions
- File names: lowercase, hyphens, no spaces
- Every wiki page starts with YAML frontmatter
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` to link between pages (minimum 2 outbound links per page)
- When updating a page, always bump the `updated` date
- Every new page must be added to `index.md` under the correct section
- Every action must be appended to `log.md`

## Frontmatter
```yaml
---
title: Page Title
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
type: entity | concept | comparison | query | summary
tags: [from taxonomy below]
sources: [raw/articles/source-name.md]
confidence: high | medium | low
---
```

## Tag Taxonomy
- **Systems**: agent, sub-agent, orchestration, pipeline, workflow, delegation
- **Techniques**: parallel-execution, context-isolation, handoff, goal-mode, kanban
- **People/Orgs**: person, company, lab, open-source
- **Concepts**: context-window, token-optimization, memory, skills, profiles
- **Meta**: comparison, timeline, controversy, prediction, best-practices

## Page Thresholds
- Create a page when an entity/concept appears in 2+ sources OR is central to one source
- Add to existing page when a source mentions something already covered
- DON'T create a page for passing mentions
- Split a page when it exceeds ~200 lines

## Update Policy
When new information conflicts with existing content:
1. Check dates — newer sources generally supersede older
2. If genuinely contradictory, note both positions with dates and sources
3. Flag for user review
